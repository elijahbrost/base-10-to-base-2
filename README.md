Things to play with

* Converting decimals with floating points, into binaries with floating points, and vise-versa
* Adding binaries, using lists of strings, instead of integers
* Subtracting binaries... doing the same
* Dividing...
* Multiplying... 
* Numerically sorting binaries (one of the ways to efficiently divide binaric strings, will require sorting)
* Find am arbitrary number of primaries
