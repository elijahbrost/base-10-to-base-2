Things to play with

* Converting decimals with floating points, into binaries with floating points, and vise-versa
* Adding binaries, using lists of strings, instead of integers
* Subtracting binaries... doing the same
* Dividing... (find a few ways to do it)
* Multiplying
* Numerically sorting binaries (one of the ways to efficiently divide binaric strings, will require sorting)
